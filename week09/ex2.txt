- To increase Hit/Miss ratio there should be less Miss cases and more Hit cases.
If we will referense same page but multiple times, the ratio will be N - 1 : 1.
Example in "large_hit_miss_ratio.txt"

- To decrease this ratio there should be more Miss cases.
For that we can referense pages that wasn't referensed before.
That way every the ratio will be 0 : N.
Example in "small_hit_miss_ratio.txt"
